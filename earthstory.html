                <h3>Southwest African Lion</h3>
                <div class="lion-description">
                    <p>The Southwest African Lion is a marvelous creature to ponder on. They can weight up till 280 pounds and run at a speed of 45 mph. Their lifespan is relatively long as compared to toher animals with an everage at 15 years. Their diet manily consits of wildebeest, buffaloes and zebras, mainly large mammals.
                        They travel in groups which provides them with protection especially when raising offspring. In addition, the way these creaters hunt is very facinating. 
                        They have soft foot pads and retractable calsw that allow these creatures to move quietly when sneaking up on a prey. They also have great body strenth which allows them to bring
                        down their prey. On the lines of hunting, these lions have eyes that let them see in very low light, so they are always ready to hunt in the middle of the night if needed. Their fur is short and mostly a brownish-orangish color as shown
                        in the picture to the left, but it can also vary from white-gray to dark brown.These lions have tongues covered with spines called papillae which are used to scrape meat from their' prey's bone as well as groom their young. 
                        However, due to poaching and hunting, they were nearly wiped out and very few remain. However, lion populations are on their way to making a recovery all thanks to the multiple reserves in Africa.

                <h3>Finn Whale</h3>
                <div class="whale-description">
                    <p>Now, going into the depths of the ocean. The ocean is an extensive territory, having over 2 million species of animals. One of these animals is known as the 
                        Finn Whale. These whales are massive, having a length of 70 feet or 21 meters. It is the seond longest species on Earth falling short of the Blue Whale. It's mass is 100,000 pounds (yes, that's a lot!!). 
                        They can travel up to speeds of 29 mph and live in deep offshore waters of the major oceans. THey have sleek, V shaped heads that helps them swim faster in the water. In addition, they hav ea tall, hooked fin that rises from an angle from their back. These whales are found
                        in social groups of two to seven whales. They hunt on small fish, known as krill as well as squid by lunging into these schools of prey. It may come as a shock,
                        but little is known about their social and mating systems. However, long-term bonds between these idnivduals are quite rare. However, the population of these creatures are declining because of enviormental change. Habiitat loss and toxins are 
                        entering the oceans at an alarming rate, a threat to all ocean wildlife. Vessel strikes have been known to kill these whales the most. These whales can get tangled in fishing gear and nets, which hinders their ability to swim.

                <h3>Black Footed Ferrat</h3>
                <div class="ferrat-description">
                    <p>The Black footed Ferrat is one of the most cutest animals in the Animal Kingdom. They are carnivorous, meaning that they eat other animals 
                        such as rats, squirrels, insects and sometimes even reptiles. They weigh a mere 2 pounds and are only around 18 to 24 inches long. 
                        These animals once used to range throughour the Norther American Great Plains but recently, they have be reintorduced inot parts of Wyoming.
                        In order to communicate, these creaters are very loud. Their loud chatter is used as an alarm call if they are in danger. A hiss is used to show if 
                        they are angry or in fear. Whimpering sounds can be used to encourage others to follow. Overall, these animals are very vocal. As strange as it may seem, most 
                        ferrats lead independent lives. In 1981, we thought that these creatures were all but extinct, but soon discovered that they were a few still living
                        in Whyoming. They were thought to be extinct because of habitat destruction. Much of the ferrats' habitat as been replaced with crops, limiting their area of hunting
                        and breeding.
